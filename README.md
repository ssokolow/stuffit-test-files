# StuffIt Test Files
This repository contains a collection of minimal, legally redistributable
StuffIt archives suitable for inclusion in test suites for programs that
incorporate StuffIt extraction functionality.

## Explain

Since there are no free tools I know of for creating
[StuffIt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StuffIt) archives, and it's
important to be able to integration-test systems that use `lsar` and `unar`
from The Unarchiver's open-source
[command-line tools](https://theunarchiver.com/command-line) to process legacy
archives, I decided to step up and create some legally redistributable
StuffIt test files.

## "How Do I Know These Are Legal?"

First, the contents are the same test files I created from
scratch and released into the public domain for my
[RAR test files](https://github.com/ssokolow/rar-test-files) repository.

As for the archives, while Smith Micro Software doesn't sell StuffIt anymore,
I bought a bunch of copies, with registration keys, off eBay (including
a New Old Stock one) and their license agreements provide a means for sellers
to transfer the license to a new licensee.

**The versions I have licenses for are:**

* StuffIt Deluxe 4.5 for 68k Macintosh
* StuffIt Deluxe 6.5 for PPC Macintosh
* StuffIt Deluxe 7.0 for PPC Macintosh
* StuffIt 7.0 for Windows
* StuffIt Deluxe 2009 for Windows
* StuffIt Deluxe 2011 for Windows and OSX (2010 for Windows, 2011 for
  OSX, **Sealed/New Old Stock**)

Sorry about the photo quality. I don't have a proper lighting setup or anything
else which would allow me to take good photos of these things, and I felt that
putting them on my scanner would make them look too much like stock photos
I might have found lying around on the web.

**NOTE:** Boldface emphasis on all license excerpts is mine.

### StuffIt Deluxe 4.5 for Macintosh

![](photos/45mac.jpg)

I don't currently have a means to run this (I'll be investigating whether it
runs under [Executor](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor_(software)>) or
[Executor 2000](https://github.com/autc04/executor)), but
the license is included in the back of the print manual:

**Relevant License Terms:**

> 3. OTHER RESTRICTIONS. You may not rent or lease the SOFTWARE, but **you
> may transfer the SOFTWARE and accompanying written materials on a
> permanent basis provided you retain no copies and the recipient agrees to the
> terms of this agreement**. [...]

### StuffIt Deluxe 6.5 for Macintosh

![](photos/65mac.jpg)

I got this as part of the same lot as 4.5 for Macintosh but, as I don't have a
PowerPC Macintosh or the original manual, I don't know what the license on it
is.

[Executor 2000](https://github.com/autc04/executor) claims to have some small
amount of PowerPC support, so I'll see if I can get it running under that.

**NOTE:** The included license key for StuffIt Deluxe 6.5 for Macintosh does
not work  for the copy of StuffIt Deluxe 7.5 for Windows that's also on the
disk.

### StuffIt Deluxe 7.0 for Macintosh

I got this as part of the same lot as 4.5 for Macintosh but, as I don't have a
PowerPC Macintosh or the original manual, I don't know what the license on it
is.

[Executor 2000](https://github.com/autc04/executor) claims to have some small
amount of PowerPC support, so I'll see if I can get it running under that.

**NOTE:** The included license key for StuffIt Deluxe 7.0 for Macintosh does
not work  for the copy of StuffIt Deluxe 7.5 for Windows that's also on the
disk.

### StuffIt 7.0 for Windows

In the absence of additional terms to the contrary,
"like any other copyrighted material (e. g., a book or musical recording)"
should mean that it's legal to buy and sell
licenses for StuffIt 7.0 for Windows as long as the seller uninstalls it
before selling the install media and destroys any backup copies they've made.

Also, you're not allowed to distribute StuffIt 7.0 Zip self-extractors for
profit without a license and I'm unsure whether registering your StuffIt 7.0
is the license being referred to.

### StuffIt Deluxe 2009 for Windows

**Relevant License Terms:**

> Except as permitted by applicable law and this EULA, you will not use, copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works from the Software or Documentation or transfer the Software or Documentation, and you will not (and will not permit any third party to) decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, rent, lease, or loan the Software. **You may, however, transfer your rights under this EULA provided you transfer the related Documentation, this EULA and a copy of the Software to a party who agrees to accept the terms of this EULA and provided you destroy all copies of the Software (or portions thereof) remaining in your possession.**   In addition, you may transfer your rights under this EULA solely in accordance with any written instructions that the Company provides in connection with the Software.

### StuffIt Deluxe 2010 for Windows

I received this copy as sealed New Old Stock.

There is no StuffIt Deluxe 2011 for Windows, so this Stuffit Deluxe 2011 hybrid CD contains Stuffit Deluxe 2010 for Windows users.

While I bought this as New Old Stock, the clause in the license which would
allow me to have purchased it used is still present:

> Except as permitted by applicable law and this EULA, you will not use, copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works from the Software or Documentation or transfer the Software or Documentation, and you will not (and will not permit any third party to) decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, rent, lease, or loan the Software. **You may, however, transfer your rights under this EULA provided you transfer the related Documentation, this EULA and a copy of the Software to a party who agrees to accept the terms of this EULA and provided you destroy all copies of the Software (or portions thereof) remaining in your possession.**   In addition, you may transfer your rights under this EULA solely in accordance with any written instructions that the Company provides in connection with the Software.

## Roadmap

* Given that Wikipedia says new StuffIt releases had a bad habit of introducing
  backwards-incompatible format changes, I'll want to investigate the license
  of Shareware StuffIt Lite releases which might run in Executor as a possible
  way to produce a wider variety of sample archives. (Specifically, whether
  they're the kind of Shareware that allows you to perpetually use a subset of
  the full version's features and distribute the produced archives freely.)
